## Getting Started

At the root of this project, create a `.env` file to store your environment variables. Please see `.env.example` to see the expected format of the variables. These environment variables will be used to connect to a postgres DB and in order to generate JSON Web Tokens.

To run the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Once launched, Graphql APIs can be accessed at: [http://localhost:9000/graphql](http://localhost:9000/graphql)
